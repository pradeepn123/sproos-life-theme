When Leah began experiencing gut-related health issues, collagen became an essential part of her self-care routine that helped her get back on her feet.<br\/><br\/>During Leah’s battle to recover her health, John watched as she became frustrated with the natural health supplement options available. Confusing labels and big price tags with little return. Combining their insight with their previous business experience and passionate belief in the health benefits of collagen, they developed their own brand — Sproos – to provide a simple, natural and functional way to get proactive about personal health.<\/p>",
